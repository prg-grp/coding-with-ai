    "# 7 Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring is about performing a code transformation that improves software design without changing its behavior([Code Refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)). Classic examples of refactoring include renaming variables and functions, breaking down a long method into multiple ones, and synthetizing setters and getters for a class field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring can be done manually or automatically (many IDEs provide support for automated refactoring, e.g., [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)). Automatic methods are analytical, correct by design, and based on static analysis. Yet AI can support refactoring -- even if with less correctness guarantees.\n"
