# 10 Modularization in Software Design

In the [Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Software_development_life_cycle) the -Planning and design- phase consists, among other activities, in deciding how to structure the application. One of the decisions that should be taken is which code units (e.g., functions) have to be defined and composed.


## 10.1 Task: Designing a To-Do List

Your project manager met with a client who is requesting a
**To-Do List Application**. After the meeting, you get to know the requirements of
the application:

*The To-Do List Application is a straightforward console-based program that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application will enable users to add tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks, and view a list of pending and completed tasks. The tasks will be stored in a text file for persistence between sessions.*

As a software engineer, you are tasked with the following:

1. Identify a list of functionalities that the software should implement.

2. Write the signature (e.g., name and parameters) of each function (no need to
   implement them).



```python
# Write the list of functionalities here:
# ...
```


```python
# Write your signatures here
```

Ask the AI to do the same steps and compare with your solution.



```python
# Write the list of functionalities here:
# ...
```


```python
# Write the signatures here
```

## 10.2 Task: Personal Expense Tracker

Consider the following project *specification*:

The Personal Expense Tracker is a Python-based console application that helps users manage and track their daily expenses. Users can add, view, edit, and delete expenses, with each entry categorized and timestamped. The application stores all expense data in a CSV file, ensuring data persistence. Users can generate basic reports to view total spending by category or within a specific date range. The project structure includes modules for handling expense operations and managing data storage.

- Use the AI to ask how to modularize the application, e.g., what are the functionalities in which you can break down the application.

- For an application this size, it is probably enough to use functions as modularization units. Ask the AI to suggest proper signatures (e.g., names and parameters) for each function.

- Ask the AI to provide an implementation of one of the functions. Your colleagues can do the same for different functions. This approach simulates an important practice in software development, where different programmers (or development teams) focus on different modules and, thanks to clear interfaces (i.e., the signatures of the functions) it is possible to easily combine the result of separate development.

- Finally, assemble all the functions to complete the project.



```python

```
