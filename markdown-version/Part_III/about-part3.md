# 15 About Part III: Software Projects with AI

This part marks a shift from small, focused exercises to broader, project-style explorations. The focus here is on putting ideas into practice—bringing together the techniques you’ve encountered so far and applying them in more open-ended, creative ways.

The exercises in this section go beyond isolated coding tasks. They involve building components such as APIs, graphical interfaces, and modular systems—situations where design decisions, architecture, and maintainability start to matter. These are opportunities to explore how AI can support you not just in writing code, but in shaping the overall structure of a project.

Unlike earlier parts, the exercises here are less linear. You’re encouraged to make choices, experiment with different approaches, and even adapt the problem itself. AI tools can support this process by generating boilerplate code, helping navigate complexity, or assisting with documentation and debugging.

Think of this part as a collection of launchpads: each project is a starting point for deeper exploration. Whether you’re refining your programming workflow or simply curious to see where AI can take you, this is a space to build, test, and iterate—on your own terms.
